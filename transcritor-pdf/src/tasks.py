        # The actual call to the (simulated) pipeline
        # Note: process_pdf_pipeline is an async function.
        # Celery tasks can be async, but it depends on the Celery version and configuration.
        # Assuming Celery is set up to handle async tasks (e.g., Celery 5+ with an asyncio worker or by running the async code within `asyncio.run()`).
        # For simplicity, if process_pdf_pipeline was synchronous, it would be a direct call.
        # If it MUST remain async and the Celery worker isn't async-native, one might do:
        # import asyncio
        # result_summary = asyncio.run(process_pdf_pipeline(file_content=file_content_bytes, filename=filename))
        # However, the `process_pdf_pipeline` in `src.processing` is already `async`.
        # For now, let's assume the Celery setup can handle invoking async functions.
        # If not, this part might need adjustment (e.g. making pipeline sync or using asyncio.run).
        # Given the current structure, Celery would need to be able to `await` this.
        # A standard Celery task is synchronous. To call async code from a sync task,
        # we need `asyncio.run()`.

        import asyncio # Ensure asyncio is imported

        # Call the async pipeline using asyncio.run()
        result_summary = asyncio.run(process_pdf_pipeline(file_content=file_content_bytes, filename=filename))
