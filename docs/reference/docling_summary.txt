# Docling - Research Summary

## Source

This summary is based on the official Docling documentation found at: [https://docling-project.github.io/docling/](https://docling-project.github.io/docling/)

## Overview

Docling is an open-source project (hosted by LF AI & Data Foundation, initiated by IBM Research) designed to simplify document processing. It parses a wide array of document formats, with a strong emphasis on advanced PDF understanding. It aims to provide seamless integrations with the generative AI ecosystem.

The project has a Python package available on PyPI, making it installable via pip: `pip install docling`
The source code is hosted on GitHub: [https://github.com/docling-project/docling](https://github.com/docling-project/docling)

## Key Features Relevant to Layout Analysis

Docling offers several features crucial for layout analysis and document understanding, which are highly relevant for the 'transcritor-pdf' project:

*   **Advanced PDF Understanding:** This is a core capability, explicitly including:
    *   Page layout analysis
    *   Reading order determination
    *   Table structure recognition
    *   Identification of code blocks, formulas
    *   Image classification within documents
*   **Unified Document Representation:** Uses a `DoclingDocument` format, which provides an expressive and consistent way to represent document content and structure.
*   **Format Support:** Parses multiple document formats, including PDF, DOCX, XLSX, HTML, images, and more.
*   **OCR Support:** Provides extensive OCR capabilities for scanned PDFs and images. This is vital for converting image-based documents (or parts of documents) into text.
*   **Visual Language Model (VLM) Support:** Integrates with VLMs, including its own `SmolDocling` (available on Hugging Face: `ds4sd/SmolDocling-256M-preview`), for tasks that benefit from visual understanding.
*   **Export Options:** Can export processed documents into various formats like Markdown, HTML, and lossless JSON. The JSON export could be particularly useful for structured data extraction.
*   **Local Execution:** Can be run locally, which is important for sensitive data and air-gapped environments.
*   **Integrations:** Designed for easy integration with AI development frameworks like LangChain, LlamaIndex, and Haystack. This aligns well with the existing architecture of 'transcritor-pdf'.
*   **CLI and Python API:** Offers both a command-line interface for quick use and a Python API for deeper integration into applications.

## Potential Usage in 'transcritor-pdf'

For the 'transcritor-pdf' project, Docling could be used in the preprocessing stage (`src/preprocessor`) to:

1.  **Analyze Page Layout:** Before or alongside OCR, Docling could identify the structural elements of each page (text blocks, images, tables). This would be a significant improvement over simple OCR of the entire page, as it allows for targeted extraction.
2.  **Determine Reading Order:** For complex multi-column layouts, Docling's reading order detection could ensure text is extracted in the correct sequence.
3.  **Extract Specific Elements:** If the project needs to handle tables or figures specifically, Docling's ability to identify these elements would be beneficial. The output `DoclingDocument` should contain coordinates and classifications of these blocks.
4.  **Improve OCR Quality:** By identifying text regions first, OCR can be applied more precisely.

## Next Steps for Integration (TASK-016)

1.  **Installation:** Add `docling` to `requirements.txt` and install it. Consider any dependencies it might have (e.g., for specific OCR engines or VLMs if used).
2.  **Basic Usage:** Experiment with the Docling Python API using a sample PDF from the project. Focus on:
    *   Loading a PDF document.
    *   Accessing the page layout information (bounding boxes of text blocks, images, tables).
    *   Understanding the structure of the `DoclingDocument` object.
3.  **Integration into `image_processor.py` (or a new module):**
    *   Create a new function or class that takes a page image (or PDF path and page number) as input.
    *   Uses Docling to process the page and extract layout information.
    *   The output should be in a format usable by downstream tasks (e.g., a list of identified block types with their coordinates and potentially pre-extracted text).
4.  **Testing:** Write unit tests for the new Docling integration, mocking external dependencies if necessary, and verifying that layout information is correctly extracted for sample pages.
